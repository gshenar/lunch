# Generalized Content Examples

* An awesome talk that you have seen "in the wild" and want to share with the community here.

* An article from the web that you want to synthesize/distill/dissect/share with us.

* Something lightweight, fun, and interactive (e.g. group activity where we spin up a "hello world" webserver
  in a handful of languages that run on the JVM, contrast and compare, and then deploy the JARs somewhere
  and see if there are any perf differences)

* Something that you, personally, have been "cooking" for a while that falls into one of the categories above.

* Something somber that provokes soulful reflection but ultimately uplifts and preseves the culture.
