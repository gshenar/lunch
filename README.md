# Lunch Club

The goal of Lunch Club is to preserve, bolster, and advance Digital's culture
of excellence and innovation by sharing stuff that we love as often as possible,
with as little friction, pomp, and ceremony as possible.

Any person at any location can share. Scrounge up and/or synthesize something awesome and share it!


## Acceptable Content

Almost anything is acceptable.

Content that challenges and/or bolsters our 'best practices', technologies,
architecture, software design patterns, culture, etc is encouraged.

See [CONTENT_EXAMPLES.md](CONTENT_EXAMPLES.md) for examples (or add some of your own).
