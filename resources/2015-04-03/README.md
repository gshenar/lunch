# Performance Talk Combo: HTTP/2 Performance, Chrome Performance Tooling

Performance is a really important factor in building great products that customers love.

In the first talk, Mark Nottingham of the HTTP Working Group talks about how to make HTTP/2 fast.
He walks through some of the details of HTTP/2 and talks about some of the strategies we used
to make HTTP/1.1 fast that will need to be retired in an HTTP/2 world.
