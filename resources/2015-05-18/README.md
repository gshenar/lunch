# Tim Pope and Vim

Tim Pope (aka `tpope`) is a prolific Vim wizard who has created many popular Vim plugins (e.g. `vim-fugitive`).

He rarely gives talks.

Maybe there's a reason for that, but in 2014 _Thoughtbot_ managed to track him down in NYC and
coerce him into spending an hour talking about his environment and talking through some
powerful common-and-uncommon things you can do with Vim while the audience asks questions.

He also makes mention of a few esoteric plugins: some that are unreleased, some that are just unpopular.
Pretty much every plugin has a clever name, for better or worse
(the nadir of these is probably [`vim-scriptease`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-scriptease) and the zenith is up-for-debate but I think it's [`vim-speeddating`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-speeddating))
