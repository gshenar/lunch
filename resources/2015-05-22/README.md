# Douglas Adams's _Hyperland_

In 1990, Douglas Adams of _The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy_ series fame writes and presents a "fantasy documentary" about hypertext and surrounding technologies. This was the same year the first web browser was released. _Mosaic_ wasn't released until 1993, so this is very early nascent stuff and (I hear) it predicts the modern web with remarkable accuracy.

This promises to be fun and maybe a little bit strange. Let's go back to 1990 for a little under and hour and get weird!
