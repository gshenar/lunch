#Implementing gratuitously animated UIs

The goal with this talk is *not* to outline the absolute best and most correct way of implementing front-end animations. I have yet to learn that. It will instead cover a day in the life of how I happen to implement the awfully complicated but really cool looking ideas our design team comes up with.

I hope to take a single example of a JIRA ticket I recently worked on and describe how I implemented it from start to finish, using pure CSS to display elements easing in and out of view one at a time, fading, pulsating, etc. I hope for it to be an interactive talk with others piping in with ideas on how things might be done more efficiently, reusably, or otherwise more awesome.
