# Some Gary Bernhardt Talks

We screened a few talks from Gary Bernhardt's excellent "Destroy All Software" series.

Episode numbers identified in parentheses for reference.

* A pair of talks on UNIX-y topics like processes and how to compose your unix commands
  to do really awesome, useful, practical things. (008, 019)

* Another talk on the benefits of writing applications with a functional core where
  all of the core behavior is written in a functional programming style,
  and an imperative 'shell', where user interaction happens through a single file
  written in an imperative coding style. (072)
