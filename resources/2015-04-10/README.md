# Vistaprint GTM Process

In this session, we will cover a few critical things (Subject to change if I get feedback):
 * Going over jira, and how it'll be important
 * Teams that own software stacks, getting tech reviews where necessary
 * Going over code release processes, and how continuous deployment works

If we have time, I might jump over to the technical side:
 * The applications we already have off-monolith
 * Some existing network infrastructure and systems
